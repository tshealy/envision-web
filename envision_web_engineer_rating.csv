The additional use of geosynthetic clay liner was added to keep the water from infiltrating and contaminating the soils. ,0,9,With the demolition of the previous impervious areas the South LA Wetlands were able to achieve a Superior rating in this category. The natural wetlands were able to restore habitat and create additional riparian areas that were not identified previously. ,0,7,For the South LA Wetlands an enhanced rating was achieved in this category. The reduction of green house gases does exist but more potential improvements to reduce these even more could have been put in place. ,0,12,"With the control of water through this site, the South LA Wetlands are able to achieve a superior rating for this credit.

Instead of spending money on materials like asphalt that get expensive, the paths could simply be dirt that was tamped down.

This will assist in preventing contamination in surface waters. In addition to this, the waters will be tested on a monthly basis to ensure the water is safe for the many species that it will house. The site will also feature a number of BMP's to ensure that runoff is properly cleaned and stored to prevent contaminated water. A curb and gutter system will also be used to collect storm water runoff from the impervious surfaces on the site and will be treated appropriately.",0,19,"A series of BMP's will be used to ensure storm water is properly filtered before returning to the water table. Also, a series of drainage basins will be included throughout the site to help manage the storm water in case of an extreme storm. This will take some of the strain off of existing water bodies in the case of such an event. The curb and gutter system will also aid in this situation. Having these facilities will ensure the hydrology and wildlife diversity of existing water bodies will not be destroyed.",0,25,"The new site calls for an extreme lack of parking spaces. The previous site featured many open parking lots that went unused for much of the year. These greyfield sites will be transformed into open green space and other important uses, chosen by the community in the many city meetings in which the new uses will be discussed. This, and the addition of bike lanes and bike facilities will discourage community members from driving to the site. The will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas emissions from the site. Also, the connected streets will provide a decrease in congestion, giving drivers an overall shorter travel time. This will also decrease greenhouse gas emissions.",0,20,"The operating costs of the site will be fairly minimal. This will ensure that infrastructure traps will not occur on the site. In addition, the potential risks of the site will be outlined and dealt with prior to the construction phase of the design. The design will also leave room for future changes to occur throughout the site by adding minimal cost-heavy infrastructure and specialized facilities. The team will ensure that the community will be left in good standing after the completion of the project. ",176,15

This also improved community attractiveness where friends or families can gather which brought some business to come such as food trucks. Thus, this project improved the economic growth and development of the community.

Bike paths were designed in appropriate locations. The project takes into consideration the preservation of natural landscape features. Balances the need for safety measures and barriers against the desire for protection or enhancement of views. ,0,13,The project includes a small entertainment area for kids and an exercise area for adults. There is a lake or stream with some colorful fishes and aesthetic natural rocks. That is also the place for the ducks or gooses and other animals to gather. There are some cook-out areas for families to gather also. ,0,4,"Establish a VSPZ for an area within 100 feet of any wetland areas, shoreline, or waterbody or within setback distances from wetlands prescribed in state or local laws and/or regulations, whichever is more stringent.",1,"",0,18,"The project cleaned up previously contaminated land, restoring wellhead protection, and installing land-use controls to prevent future contamination. Restoration also included removal of materials storage piles, rerouting of surface runoff, or restoring groundwater infiltration patterns to prevent groundwater contamination.

Documentation provided by a resource professional team outlining strategies for ecosystem functions and a description of, and restoration plan for, any disturbed ecosystem functions",0,13,"Using a completed life-cycle carbon assessment, the project team worked to design the project so that it reduced the anticipated amount of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40%, reducing project contribution to climate change. Documentation that a life-cycle carbon assessment or a carbon footprint analysis has been performed in accordance with available methodologies, data sources, and software.",0,2,The project included fences around some areas that are needed to help for easy maintenance and protection. ,207,0

By creating a town center, more people will want to live in the area and interact with community members.",0,4,"Make the Brownstone a stop on existing bus routes so people do not need a car to reach it. Implement wide sidewalks that are protected, so people feel safe walking and will do it more.
