9,2707,0,20,"This is a project that should not require intense amounts of energy, especially after the construction process. Throughout the construction phase, the parking lots and restroom facilities should be the largest consumptions of energy and materials. Once construction is completed there will not be much requirement for involvement on the site. Maybe there will need to be litter removal or maintenance on the restroom facility, but that will be a rare event. ",-2,0,12,"Due to this project being centered around a wastewater treatment park, it is important that the team lead by example and carry over sustainable practices into the design and construction processes. Materials and equipment should not have significant environmental impacts.",-1,0,10,"The team could consider a theme of recycling for the renovation of the building. The building could be partially constructed from recycled materials. This could also be used with the park benches and bridges. As for the waste from construction, it should be made an effort to contain such a stream of waste and let it be treated at the park once construction is complete.",-1,0,7,"Similar to RA1.4, recycling plans should be set in place. The project should aim to recycle as much as possible. Afterall, the project is that of sustainability. ",-1,0,4,"This project involves a lot of cut without a lot of fill. This is an issue, however, the terrain of the park could have slight contour and gradients in different areas. This would both take care of excess cut and provide for a more aesthetically pleasing park. Any excess soil can be used for other park construction in the area, assuming there are other parks in construction due to the lack of parks currently.",-2,0,1,"The project is going to involve significant amounts of earth to be moved. This requires heavy machinery that burns fossil fuels. This is inevitable, but if proper planning is done then the earth can be moved more efficiently. Thus fewer fossil fuels would be burned and money would be saved.",-1,0,22,This is essentially the reason behind the project. It is a wastewater treatment area that will also be used as a park. The project should be making a net positive impact on the environment and surrounding watershed system. It does also involve the replenishing of aquifers. If a maximum effort is not set forth to preserve water resources then this project may be considered not fully successful.,0,0,17,"Like RA3.1, if this concept is not achieved then the project is not successful. The project serves to purify water, but not to a drinkable scale. Therefore the water is not purified but still treated for other uses.",-1,0,8,"There is not a need for water consumption in the construction phase. The majority of construction involves excavation. Water can even be retracted from use in growing plants on site. Once water is flowing through the pond, it may be used for growing the plants along with rainwater before the system is fully operational. Good planning is important for success here.",-2,1,0,This site is in the city. It is not a preexisting park. The ecological value of this site will not exist until the park is constructed.,0,0,17,"The site should trap as much stormwater as it can. This water can be treated on site. The one issue is that stormwater on the parking lot may runoff outside of the site. The parking lot and building also reduce the rate of absorption of rain and water into the site's ground. However, proper leveling and gutters can aid in directing stormwater towards the pond.",-2,0,12,"Generally, the more vegetation that exists on the site the more harmful chemicals will be absorbed. This is important because the site's goal is to act as a wastewater treatment plant via vegetation. The problem here is that the more vegetation needed or required for the site the more money those plants are going to cost.",1,0,14,This is quite similar to NW2.3. In order to protect the water and treat it there needs to be a lot of plants on the site. This costs money but is important to the functionality of the project. The more plants the better.,1,1,0,"The project is being constructed in the center of a city. There are not green habitats nearby, and it is known that very few parks exist in this area.",0,0,25,"Although the construction of the project will involve heavy usage of fossil fuels, the project's long lifespan will eventually reverse this issue mainly through the vegetation. The plants will not only capture harmful chemicals in the water, but in basic vegetational functions CO2 will be taken from the air and turned into oxygen. The more vegetation on the site the faster the project will become carbon negative.",0,12

This saves on demolition materials that need to be removed as well as new materials. Much of the greenspace will require new landscape development materials however, which will have a significant cost.",-1,1,0,"There is not much detail on recycling of building materials, so it is hard to say if value is lost or saved in this area",-3,0,4,"From the renderings of the plan it looks like there will be a good amount of earthwork done, however the project may be able to be completed with little movement of soil or materials on or off the site.",0,0,8,The overall goal of the project is to change an industrial/office space park into a natural looking greenspace. The reduced car traffic should decrease the amount of air pollution due to transportation in general by a large amount.,-3,0,17,"One of the two overall goals of the project is to provide a signficant capacity for water reclamation. This will provide significant value to the community and considering the space is only 9 acres, reclaiming 0.68MGD of water is a good metric of the value the project provides and could provide savings to the local community depending on how that water can be used and what value the park adds to nearby properties.",-1,0,13,"This project turns an area of water use into an area of water reclamation, meaning it greatly improves the use of this area of land. Depending on the operation and maintenance requirements of the project it might be anywhere between some savings and a large savings.",-1,0,3,"Assuming good practices are used during construction there should be little waste of water during construction. A couple strategies that could be used include using existing groundwater to form the ponds of the park, and another could be to reuse utility lines if possible to save resources on new ones.",0,1,0,The current site does not look to have much natural habitat for wildlife and therefor not much ecological value to begin with so this criteria is hard to apply to this project.,-3,1,0,The plans do not indicate what kind of storm water protection will be provided by this project therefor it is hard to apply this metric to the project.,-3,0,5,The current site does not have much greenspace and so it won't likely have much pesticide or fertilizer use currently. If the new facility is managed with a better selected pesticide and fertilizer than it could provide some benefit to the project as a whole.,0,0,9,This park should help to improve the quality of water and wastewater that it reclaims. Although it is not yet to drinking water standards the water is being improved and could be put to other uses.,-3,0,18,One thing this project does well is to create terrestrial habitats and greenspace for existing plant and animal populations to live in. Not only does it preserve existing habitats but creates several acres of new habitat which could allow for several types of ecosystems to reclaim the land.,0,0,18,"In general as the land is re-purposed for a communal park and water reclamation system, carbon footprint should decrease as the facility will look to use less energy and more efficiently use the land to combat receding water resources in the local area. This project should be at least carbon neutral in the long run when considering energy used during construction and the water treatment productivity that the facility will provide.",-1,10
8,2792,0,15,Engineers can take inventory on the materials that they have before starting the project to ensure that they have most of the materials near the site to reduce transportation from the manufacturer.,-2,0,7,"By having policies in place to have at least 25% of the materials come from sustainable manufacturers, it helps to preserve the environment where the materials are made and it help protect the earth.",1,0,16,Engineers can collect recyclable materials and potentially reuse some of the materials when needed.
