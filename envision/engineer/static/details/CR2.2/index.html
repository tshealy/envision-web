        <p><b>CR2.2 AVOID TRAPS AND VULNERABILITIES</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Avoid traps and vulnerabilities that could create high long-term costs and risks for the affected communities.</p>
        <p>Metric: Assessment of potential long-term traps, vulnerabilities, and risks caused by long-term changes such as climate change and the degree to which these were addressed in the project design and in community design criteria.</p>

                <p><b>(2) Basic evaluation.</b> During the conceptual or preplanning phase, the project team conducts a survey of possible resource constraints and vulnerabilities that the community could face in the future, including those expected because of climate change. The team identifies potential approaches and practices to address. The team also reviews appropriate local regulations and standards. Some consideration in the project design stage to address issues.

                <p><b>(6) High-level review.</b> The project team works with the community at the conceptual stages of the project and conducts a high-level review of projected resource demands and supplies, resource and infrastructure traps, and vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to understand how the project might affect community vulnerabilities and resource dependencies. An assessment is made of the associated long-term risks. Projectspecific issues are raised. Basic plans are developed to address issues. (A)</p>

                <h4 class="loa-color">Superior</h4>
                <p><b>(12) Detailed evaluation.</b> The project owner and the team work more directly with community decision makers and stakeholders, taking a fresh look at potential resource issues, vulnerabilities, and risks. The parties conduct a more integrated risk assessment of community vulnerabilities and resource dependencies, and determine ways that design changes in the project can result in significant risk reductions. Alternatives are developed and discussed. Detailed plans are developed to address issues. (A, B)</p>

                <p><b>(16) Comprehensive assessment.</b> Work with community decision makers and stakeholders to make a full and comprehensive assessment of resource demands and supplies, resource and infrastructure traps, and vulnerabilities. Use the assessment as a basis for making changes to the project design. Considerations include how the project contributes to the community's assessment of resource demands and supplies, as well as resource and infrastructure traps, and vulnerabilities. (A, B, C)</p>

Assess long-term risks and consider alternatives. Convert that assessment into design criteria for this project and make recommendations regarding the design criteria for future infrastructure.
