        <p><b>CR1.1 REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Conduct a comprehensive life-cycle carbon analysis and use this assessment to reduce the anticipated amount of net greenhouse gas emissions during the life cycle of the project, reducing project contribution to climate change.</p>
        <p>Metric: Life-cycle net carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.</p>

                <p><b>(4) Life-cycle carbon assessment.</b> A comprehensive life-cycle carbon assessment is undertaken to estimate carbon emissions caused by materials extraction and processing, transportation of materials to be used during construction and operation, and project maintenance and operation, including vehicle traffic. The assessment related to materials includes carbon emissions generated for the key materials to be used in the project from their extraction, refinement, and manufacture, distance transported, and carbon emissions released in use after their incorporation to the completed project.
