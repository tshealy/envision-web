        <p><b>NW2.3 PREVENT SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Preserve freshwater resources by incorporating measures to prevent pollutants from contaminating surface and groundwater and monitor impacts over operations.</p>
        <p>Metric: Designs, plans, and programs instituted to prevent and monitor surface and groundwater contamination.</p>

        <h3>Levels of Achievement</h3>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Improved</h4>
                <p><b>(1) Design for response.</b> Protection is accomplished by spill and leak diversion systems, spill prevention plans, and cleanup. (A, B)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Enhanced</h4>
                <p><b>(4) On-site monitoring.</b> Measures have been incorporated into the design and operation of the project to enable onsite water quality monitoring and reporting. Monitoring will include surface and groundwater quantity and quality. Monitored data include water quality data and temperature data. (A, B)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Superior</h4>
                <p><b>(9) Design for prevention.</b> During the design stage, the location of equipment and facilities containing potentially polluting substances are located away from sensitive environments. Runoff interceptors and drainage channels are designed to accommodate pollutants in stormwater runoff or ice melt, potential spills, and leakage. Spill prevention and response plans are in place. During operation, methods to monitor and minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff or ice melt are used. (A, B, C)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Conserving</h4>
                <p><b>(14) Design for source elimination.</b> Designers focus on eliminating potentially polluting substances from operations. If unable to do so, designers seek to recycle the substances, keeping them within the operation or sending them off site for use in other applications. Designers continue to address prevention measures by identifying equipment and facilities containing potentially polluting substances and locating them away from sensitive environments. (A, B, C)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Restorative</h4>
                <p><b>(18) Remediate existing contamination.</b> The project prevents future contamination by cleaning up previously contaminated land, restoring wellhead protection, and installing land-use controls to prevent future contamination. Restoration also may include removal of materials storage piles, rerouting of surface runoff, or restoring groundwater infiltration patterns. (A, B, C, D)</p>

    <div class="evaluation">
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Have adequate and responsive surface and groundwater quantity and quality monitoring systems been incorporated into the project design?</li>
            <ol type="1">
                <li> Documentation of hydrogeologic delineation studies, taking into consideration the complexity of the aquifers. (Note that delineation already may have been done by local authorities.)</li>
                <li>For projects situated in areas where the groundwater is used as a source or drinking water, documentation of wellhead protection plans and other requirements including establishing wellhead protection areas.</li>
                <li>Documentation of surface and groundwater quality monitoring programs.</li>
                <li>Documentation that the completed project cannot reasonably have any impact on receiving waters. Show that there is no direct connection to receiving waters from the site of the construct work or that pollutant best management practices are implemented and both the discharges to receiving waters and the receiving waters themselves are monitored to verify pollutant loading, biological impact, and the impact on receiving water flow.</li>
