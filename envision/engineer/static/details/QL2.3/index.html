        <p><b>QL2.3   MINIMIZE LIGHT POLLUTION</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Prevent excessive glare, light at night, and light directed skyward to conserve energy and reduce obtrusive lighting.</p>
        <p>Metric: Lighting meets minimum standards for safety, but does not spill over into areas beyond site boundaries or create obtrusive and disruptive glare.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Improved</h4>
                <p><b>(1) Cost savings focus.</b> The project team conducts an overall assessment of lighting needs for the project. The team looks for opportunities to reduce or eliminate outdoor lighting based on potential cost savings. Appropriate measures are taken to prevent light spillage and glare in the design. Design specifications require the use of energy-efficient lighting and use of automatic turnoff of outdoor lighting during off hours. The design meets requirements for digital signage. Specify lighting requirements and limitations for the construction contractor. (A, B)</p>

            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Enhanced</h4>
                <p><b>(2) Non-lighting alternatives.</b> The project team makes additional reductions in the amount of lighting required by using nonlighting alternatives (e.g., clear signage and clearly painted roadway lines). The design reduces light-spillage effects and glare through strategies such as high barriers and planted trees and shrubs. (A, B, C)</p>

            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Superior</h4>
                <p><b>(4) Cohesive zoning.</b> The project team aligns the project with appropriate lighting zones and existing zoned districts. The team establishes lighting zones based on lighting needs balanced against the needs and limitations posed by sensitive environments and receptors. The team assesses street lighting needs and specifies the removal of unneeded street lighting. (A, B, C)</p>

                <h4 class="loa-color">Conserving</h4>
                <p><b>(8) Preserving the night sky.</b> The project team performs an audit of lighting needs for all the areas affected by the project. The team assesses lighting needs and makes recommendations for overall lighting needs and reducing light spillage. The design specifies outdoor lighting with full cutoff lenses and reductions in lighting intensity for preserving the night sky. The team optimizes energy efficiency, considering time-of-day lighting needs and the use of energyefficient lamps. (A, B, C)</p>

            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Restorative</h4>
                <p><b>(11) Restoring the night sky.</b> The project team works with lighting experts to assess true lighting needs as well as areas where exterior lighting is directed upward. The team identifies more fully where, when, and to what levels lighting is needed to meet wayfinding, safety and other illumination requirements. The team identifies and appropriately reduces or eliminates lighting where existing lighting is negatively impacting dark sky conditions. Extensive use of appropriate time-of-day lighting schedule. Broad application of full cutoff lenses. Optimize energy efficiency and assess and optimize energy expenditures. Focus on reducing unnecessary upward illumination. (A, B, C)</p>
