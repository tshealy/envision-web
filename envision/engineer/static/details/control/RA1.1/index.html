        <b><ol type="A"></b>
          <b><li>Has the project team determined materials that are the primary contributors to energy intensity for the project during construction and operation?</b></li>
          <b><ol type="1"></b>
            <em><li>Documentation of the primary materials to be used in the construction and ongoing operation of the project over its life. Documentation should include:</li>
            <li>Documentation explaining potential impacts to surface and/or groundwater quality, their risk, and consequences. Water temperature should be included as a potential impact.</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>The materials used.</li>
              <li>General estimates of the quantities of materials used. Note that operations materials may need to be multiplied by the frequency of use over the project life. Material estimates should include anticipated repairs/upkeep such as road resurfacing.</li>
              <li>Estimates of the embodied energy of materials. Estimates may use readily available public information such as regional, national, or global averages.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Identification of the select materials that collectively will make up over 80% of the total estimated embodied energy of the project.</li></em></p>

            <b><ol type="1"></b>
              <em><li>Index of the embodied energy calculations of the primary contributors to energy intensity identified in criterion A. This should include:</li>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Energy consumed to produce the material including raw material extraction, refinement, and manufacture including secondary or tertiary processing.</li>
                  <li>Energy consumed transporting the material from the manufacturer to the project site, including intermediary points.</li>
                  Embodied energy data may come from the manufacturer, reputable databases, reputable embodied energy software, or from project team calculations. If the source or specific type of materials is not known at the time of assessment, calculations may present a range of values or rely on likely material choices. All calculations should be expressed in standard embodied energy or energy intensity units of megajoules (MJ) or gigajoules (GJ) per unit weight (kg or tonne) or area (m2 / ft2).</li></p></em>

               </ol>
               <li> Calculations of reductions in embodied energy achieved.
