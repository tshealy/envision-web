            <em><li>Identification of sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Sources include direct emissions from facilities owned or controlled within the project boundary (often referred to as Scope 1), as well as indirect emissions from the off-site generation of energy used by the project (often referred to as Scope 2). Other indirect emissions (often referred to as Scope 3) are not included in the calculations. Emissions should be classified by the following categories:</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Off-site Energy Generation</li>
              <li>Stationary Fuel Combustion Emissions (non-vehicular combustion occurring at the facility intended for energy production)</li>
              <li>Operations Transportation Emissions</li>

              <em><li>Calculations of the benchmark greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                  <li>Submit calculations for (1) the projects estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the project; (2) the time period over which the calculations are made (e.g. 2025-2050); and (3) calculations of the benchmark used over the same time period. Calculations should include any natural or mechanical methods of carbon sequestration. Purchased carbon offsets may be included in the calculations. All greenhouse gas emissions should be converted into tons/tonnes of CO2e (tCO2e).</li></em>
