        <b><li>To what extent have water conservation strategies been implemented during construction?</li></b>
  <b><ol type="1"></b>
          <em><li>Documentation that the project has implemented water conservation strategies during construction. Strategies that meet the credit requirements include:</li>
  <b><ol type="a"></b>
<li>High efficient fixtures in construction trailers or offices (demonstrate a 40% reduction in usage)</li>
<li>Monitoring and management (demonstrate teamâ€™s ability to detect leaks and respond to inefficiencies in the system)</li>
<li>Reduce embodied water of materials by reducing waste material (Calculate a 10% reduction in material quantities entering the site as new material)</li>
<li>Use alternatives to dust suppression such as dry agents (show 50% reduction in water usage due to alternative controls)</li>
<li>Alternatives for curing concrete (show 50% reduction in water usage due to alternative controls)</li>
<li>Alternatives for truck tire wash stations (show 50% reduction in water usage due to alternative controls)</li>
<li>Reduced embodied water through material selection (permanent and temporary materials) (Demonstrate how product selection has contributed to reduced potable water consumption by more than 25%)</li>
<li>Stormwater harvesting (Show 40% savings by using harvested stormwater)</li>
<li>Greywater reuse (Show 40% savings by reusing on-site grey water)</li>
  </ol>
<li>Calculation of potable water saved (gallons/litres) for each strategy as compared to not implementing the strategy over the construction duration.</li>
Note that projects may wish to also calculate their cost savings for reduction measures.</li></em>
