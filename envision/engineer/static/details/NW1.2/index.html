        <p><b>NW1.2 PROTECT WETLANDS AND SURFACE WATER</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Protect, buffer, enhance, and restore areas designated as wetlands, shorelines, and waterbodies by providing natural buffer zones, vegetation, and soil-protection zones.</p>
        <p>Metric: Size of natural buffer zone established around all wetlands, shorelines, and waterbodies.</p>

                <h4 class="loa-color">Improved</h4>
                <p><b>(1) Avoid development and establish at least a 50-foot buffer.</b> Avoid development on sites that contain or are located within 50 feet of wetlands, shorelines, or waterbodies. Additionally, if applicable, establish a vegetation and soil protection zone (VSPZ) for an area within 50 feet of any wetland areas, shoreline, or waterbody or within setback distances from wetlands prescribed in state or local laws and/or regulations, whichever is more stringent. Activities prohibited in this buffer zone include construction of any structure or road, native vegetation removal, and grading, filling, dredging, or excavation. (A, B)</p>

    <div class="evaluation">
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Is the project located on a site that neither contains nor is located within the specified distance of vernal pools, wetlands, shorelines, or waterbodies, unless located on a previously developed site?</li>
            <ol type="1">
                <li> Documentation that the proposed site neither contains nor is within the specified distance of a wetland, vernal pool, shoreline, waterbody, or other aquatic resource.</li>
            </ol>
        <li>If the site contains wetlands or waterbodies, has the project team established a VSPZ to provide a natural zone unaffected by development that maintains a buffer equal to the specified distance?</li>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>A site plan showing the final site design, the boundaries of the VSPZ, and the minimal VSPZ depth calculated as the shortest point between the VSPZ boundary and the identified wetland, waterbody, or shoreline.</li>
            </ol>
        <li>Has the project team restored previously degraded buffer zones to a natural state on a previously developed site?</li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>A restoration plan outlining any efforts to restore wetlands or waterbodies that includes, at a minimum, a site map outlining locations of restoration and proof that both required action types were taken. Restoration must include</li>
          </ol>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Stabilization of the stream channel or shoreline (bulkheads are not an acceptable stabilization measure for this objective)</li>
                <li>Revegetation with native plant communities. Stream channel restoration must include a geomorphic analysis of the reach and planning for dynamically stable stream banks based on channel dynamics and sediment transport.</li>
