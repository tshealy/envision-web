        <p><b>QL2.5   ENCOURAGE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Improve accessibility to non-motorized transportation and public transit. Promote alternative transportation and reduce congestion.</p>
        <p>Metric: The degree to which the project has increased walkability, use of public transit, non- motorized transit.</p>

                <p><b>(15) Reviving transportation options.</b> The project is designed and constructed in a way that rehabilitates pathways, bikeways, rail and/or water modes of transportation that were unused and/or in disrepair and/or removes barriers to use of alternative modes of transportation. The project integrates these underutilized assets into the existing transportation infrastructure, and the larger transportation infrastructure strategy. (A, B, C, D, E, F)</p>
