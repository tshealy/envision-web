        <h4>Documentation Summary:</h4>
        <p>The Concept Report references the Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan which is a document specifying the goals and objectives for the neighborhood in the future.  According to the Community Plan, the area has seen some inconsistent land use developments over the years that have created issues for the community.  The project helps to resolve these issues by meeting the goals and objectives summarized in the Community Plan. The Community Plan identified a lack of open space within the area.</p>

        <p>All existing lighting was removed from the project site. The project team conducted an overall assessment of lighting needs for the project, which revealed that only security lighting is required. Accordingly, security lighting zones along the pedestrian walkways were established. The project uses solar lights with cut off lenses to reduce both lighting energy requirements and light spillage.</p>

        <p>Project is located within a convenient walking distance to bus transit lines operated by Metro and LADOT.  The topography of the project site is flat.
            Traffic and parking study was conducted during the EIR process.  Based on the analysis and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT’s) criteria for significance of impact, the proposed project would not be considered to have significant impacts and no mitigation measures would be required. The South Los Angeles Wetland Park is a community resource for pedestrians and transit users.  The park includes a parking lot in the southeast corner of the site to accommodate visitors.  Although the traffic and parking study estimated a demand of 170 parking stalls, 67 parking stalls were provided to encourage alternative modes of transportation.  The few trips that will be generated can be limited by less parking available. </p>

        <h4>Documentation Summary:</h4>
        <p>The site was a maintenance yard for buses and trolleys that sprawled a full city block, covered by more than nine acres of asphalt and concrete, encircled by a rusted chain link fence and razor wire in the center of a blighted part of South Los Angeles.  As documented in the EIR, the project site did not have any scenic vistas within or surrounding the site. The main historical building was mothballed to preserve the site’s historical character (reference QL3.1).   The remaining blight buildings were demolished and the views from the neighboring school, church, and homes were improved.  The project improved the overall visual character as it transformed all nine acres of the blight maintenance yard to landscaped public space for the community.

        <p>The site was a maintenance yard for buses and trolleys that sprawled a full city block, covered by more than nine acres of asphalt and concrete, encircled by a rusted chain link fence and razor wire in the center of a blighted part of South Los Angeles.  Being surrounded by homes and schools, the site made an ideal locale for an urban park with restored natural features and green space. Primary goal of project is storm water treatment by minimizing the discharge of pollutants from urban run off to receiving waters.  The project achieved this goal, while at the same time enhancing community livability by providing a number of community resources, including wetland and riparian habitat, trails, boardwalks, and educational and public use facilities. Transcript from public hearing for the Draft EIR, as well as published articles, document the support and satisfaction from public agencies which include the City Council Office, City of Los Angeles Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering, Bureau of Sanitation, Department of Recreation and Parks, and the community.</p>

        <p>The project remediated an existing Brownfield site (reference NW1.7). The land use designation for the site was changed from Light Industrial to Open Space (reference NW2.1).
            There are no equipment or facilities on site that contain potentially polluting substances. The project is designed to collect 100% of dry weather runoff from the regional storm drain network. A series of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are designed to enhance the quality of runoff prior to release back to the storm drain network, therefore minimizing the discharge of pollutants from urban run-off to receiving waters. Bureau of Sanitation (BOS) regularly visits the site to monitor water quality.
            In addition, all three wetland cells are lined with a primary geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) to form an impermeable layer that 1) prevents water loss via infiltration and 2) prevents infiltration into the former Brownfield site. GCLs are primarily used as low-permeability barrier layers in waste-containment systems, and are a promising barrier material for situations in which differential settlement is expected. For additional spill and leak prevention, the wetland cells are lined with a secondary linear low-density polyethylene liner. The project also includes ultrasonic level sensors in the wetland itself to mitigate potential water loss.
            The pump station includes an infrared combustible gas detector that is wired to shut down the pump station if oil or other volatile hydrocarbons pass through the pre-treatment system.

        <h4>Documentation Summary:</h4>
        <p>The project significantly reduced impervious cover by transforming a previously paved site to an urban park. A wetland with riparian and emergent marsh habitat was created at the center of a densely populated urban community. The project is designed to divert stormwater runoff from the adjacent 63” storm drain and use the runoff as a resource to sustain the constructed wetland and its natural habitat. In addition to the treatment wetland, a pre-treatment hydrodynamic separator is designed to remove sediment, trash, oil and grease from a 525-acre watershed. As a result, natural water hydrology is not disrupted and water quality is enhanced by reducing pollutant loads to the impaired waters of Los Angeles.

        <p>The project is a former industrial site converted to public open space with walking trails. The project includes Brownfields cleanup and wetlands restoration. The project team was involved in converting the land use designation of the site from Light Industrial to Open Space. According to the project’s Environmental Impact Report (EIR), green house gas (GHG) emissions would be reduced following implementation of the South Los Angeles Wetland Park. Project includes walking trails that would encourage walking/biking instead of car transportation, leading to further reductions in air pollutant emissions.

        <h4>Documentation Summary:</h4>
        <p>The project team identified and assessed possible changes in key engineering design variables such as water balance. The project team conducted a comprehensive water balance study during pre-design efforts considering different evapotranspiration rates and wetland sizes. Actual flow monitoring was conducted to understand how much dry-weather runoff (source water supply) would be available from the 63” storm drain.
            The project team understood the potential of droughts and decreased dry-weather runoff in the future due to water conservation measures. Also, assuming that similar stormwater treatment projects are constructed in the future, the source water supply should diminish over time. Therefore, flexible operation features were built into the project such that the wetland may be operated differently. The three cells that make up the wetland are designed to operate independently. Valves are installed so that stormwater may be pumped to any of the three cells. Sluice gates and end caps for the orifices are designed to isolate any of the three cells. This flexibility provides opportunity to reconfigure the wetland in the event that source water is reduced (i.e., consider converting one of the cells to park space).
