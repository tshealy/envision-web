                <h4 class="loa-color">Improved</h4>
                <p><b>(1) Project only focus.</b> Community growth and development is measurable but confined to the economic contribution of the delivery of a single project. The economics of the project are the only contribution to economic growth and development. That contribution primarily consists of jobs created during design and construction. (A)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Enhanced</h4>
                <p><b>(2) Significant and desirable development.</b> The completed project contributes to community growth and development by adding a new operating capacity or increasing the quality of existing capacity. Capacity additions can apply to business and industry. They also can apply to the public in terms of cultural and recreational facilities and infrastructure. Additional jobs are created because of this development. (A, B)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Superior</h4>
                <p><b>(5) Improving local productivity.</b> Additional access and increases in the number and quality of choices are sufficient to substantially increase local productivity. Need for repair or refurbishment of existing infrastructure is considered. Cost-effective access to business and industry-related infrastructure increases productivity. The completed project fosters an expansion of the local skill base. (A, B, C)</p>

                <h4 class="loa-color">Conserving</h4>
                <p><b>(13) Business and people attractiveness.</b> The completed project is designed to contribute substantially to community attractiveness for compatible businesses and industries by improving the overall business environment. This may include increased productivity, costeffective access to facilities and infrastructure, and enhanced cultural and recreational opportunities. People want to live and work in the community. (A, B, C, D)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Restorative</h4>
                <p><b>(16) Developmental rebirth.</b> During early development stages, the project owner and project team work with the community to identify existing community assets in the natural or built environment that, if restored, would improve the economic growth and development capacity of the community. The completed project improves attractiveness through restoration of existing infrastructure, including physical, knowledge, and social assets. It is adaptive to changing conditions.
