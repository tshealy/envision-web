        <p><b>RA1.4 DIVERT OPERATIONAL WASTE FROM LANDFILLS </b></p>
        <p>Intent: Avoid extra costs by beneficially reducing and reusing operational waste and divert waste streams from disposal to recycling.</p>
        <p>Metric: Percentage of total operational waste diverted from disposal.</p>

    <div class="evaluation">
        <b><ol type="A"></b>
          <b><li>Does the project include recycling bins where appropriate?</b></li>
            <em><ol type="1">
               <li>Documentation that project teams determined whether providing recycling bins is appropriate.</li>
            <em><ol type="2">
               <li>Documentation of locations of any recycling bins provided in the project.</li></em>
        <b><ol type="B"></b>
          <li><b>To what extent has the project team reduced waste, or diverted waste from landfills?</b></li>
           <em><ol type="1">
               <li>Identification of waste streams that will occur during the operations of the project (e.g. sludge produced from the treatment of wastewater, byproduct or residual materials produced as a result of waste to energy facilities).</li>
           <em><ol type="2">
               <li>Documentation of how the project was planned or designed in order to reduce the generation of waste during operations or to divert operational waste from landfills. Documentation includes waste type and methods to reduce waste generation.</li>
           <em><ol type="3">
               <li>Calculations of estimated total waste reduction measures and percentage of materials diverted to recycling or reuse. The percentage of diverted waste should be calculated as the ratio of material diverted from landfills against the total waste generated during construction or operations. Calculations may be done by weight, volume, or cost, but must remain consistent throughout the credit. Waste deemed hazardous should not be included in the total waste calculations and should be disposed of according to local, state/provincial, and federal law. However, measures to reduce the generation of hazardous waste may be included in the calculations when appropriate.</li>
