    <div class="evaluation">
        <b><ol type="A"></b>
          <b><li>Has the project team developed  acomprehensive waste management plan to decrease project waste and divert waste from landfills during construction?</b></li>
            <em><ol type="1">
               <li>Documentation of the construction waste management plan,</li>
               OR;</li>
               Policies, specifications, or contract documents indicating a construction management plan will be developed and implemented.</li>
               <li>Documentation that the construction management plan was implemented.</li></em>
        <b><ol type="B"></b>
          <li><b>To what extent has construction waste been diverted from landfills?</b></li>
           <em><ol type="1">
               <li>Policies, specifications, contract documents, or commitments by the project team to achieve a target construction waste diversion rate.</li>
               <li>Provide a general description of each type/category of construction and demolition materials generated, location of receiving agent, and quantity of waste diverted (by category) in weight (tons) or volume (cubic yards/metres).</li>
               <li>Calculations of total waste reduction measures and percentage of materials diverted to recycling or reuse. The percentage of diverted waste should be calculated as the ratio of material diverted from landfills against the total waste generated during construction. Calculations may be done by weight (tons) or volume (cubic yards/metres) but must remain consistent throughout the credit.</li>
               Note that waste deemed hazardous should not be included in the total waste calculations and should be disposed of according to local, state/provincial, and federal law. Measures to reduce the generation of hazardous waste may be included under the project teamâ€™s consideration.</li>
