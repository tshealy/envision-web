        <p><b>NW3.1 ENHANCE FUNCTIONAL TERRESTRIAL HABITATS </b></p>
        <p>Intent: Avoid the loss of value of the region by preserving and improving the functionality of the site and the surrounding natural habitat.</p>
        <p>Metric: The number of habitat functions addressed in order to preserve or enhance the net amount and quality of functional habitat.
