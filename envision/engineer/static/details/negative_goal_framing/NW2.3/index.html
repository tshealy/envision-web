        <p><b>NW2.3 REDUCE PESTICIDE AND FERTILIZER IMPACTS </b></p>
        <p>Intent: Avoid risks to human health by reducing the quantity, toxicity, bioavailability, and persistence of pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
        <p>Metric: Efforts made to reduce the quantity, toxicity, bioavailability, and persistence of pesticides and fertilizers used on site, including the selection of plant species and the use of integrated pest management techniques.
