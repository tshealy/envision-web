          <b><li>Has the project team conducted planning and design reviews to identify potable water reduction strategies during operation of the project?</b></li></p>
          <b><ol type="1"></b>
            <em><li>Documentation the project team conducted planning and design reviews to identify potable water reduction strategies during operation of the project. Example documents may include reports, memoranda, and minutes of meetings with project teams and owners regarding water reduction strategies.</li></p></em>
             </ol>
        <b><li>To what extent has the project reduced potable water use?</li></p></b>
          <b><ol type="1"></b>
          <em><li>Calculation of the industry benchmark for potable water use to be used as a baseline.</li>
          <li>Calculations of estimated annual potable water consumption over the life of the project. Document the percentage reduction over the industry baseline. Calculations should be converted into standard units such as gallons or cubic meters. Note, water treatment projects should address this credit through reducing process water and improved process efficiency.</li></p></em>

  <b><li>To what extent has the project reduced overall wateruse (including potable and nonpotable water)?</li></p></b>
<b><ol type="1"></b>
    <em><li>Calculation of the industry benchmark for overall water use to be used as a baseline. In some cases this may be the same calculation as the baseline for potable water use in criterion B.</li>
    <li>Calculations of estimated annual total water consumption over the life of the project, and the percentage reduction over the industry baseline. Calculations should be converted into standard units such as gallons or cubic meters.</li>
Note that water treatment projects should address this credit through reducing process water and improved process efficiency.</li></p></em>
</ol>
<b><li>Does the project have a net positive impact on water use?</b></li>
<b><ol type="1"></b>
<em><li>Design documents demonstrating that the project achieves a 100% reduction in potable water use, using no water or meeting water needs entirely through nonpotable sources, and provides an available source of usable water (potable or nonpotable) for neighboring projects or communities to offset their own water needs.</li></em>
